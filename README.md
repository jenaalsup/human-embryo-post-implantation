# Data and Analysis for Human Embryo Post-Implantation Project

## Carnegie Virtual Human Embryo Data

10 sections used per stage (from one embryo)

### Stage 5b (~9 days post-fertilization)

* Total z-section: [TBD]
* Epiblast visible in slices: [TBD]
* Selected slices (middle 10 w/ epiblast): [TBD]

### Stage 5c (~11 to 12 days post-fertilization)

* Total z-sections: 140
* Epiblast present in slices: 56-83
* Selected slices (middle 10 w/ epiblast) chosen slices (middle 10): 65-74 (inclusive)

Reference tissue width measured using the Virtual Human Embryo viewer for each selected section:
- Slice 65: 717 µm 
- Slice 66: 716 µm
- Slice 67: 717 µm
- Slice 68: 717 µm
- Slice 69: 716 µm
- Slice 70: 717 µm
- Slice 71: 717 µm
- Slice 72: 717 µm
- Slice 73: 716 µm
- Slice 74: 717 µm

The modal reference width across selected sections was **717 µm** and was used for image calibration.

Images were calibrated in Fiji using this reference distance measured in the Virtual Human Embryo viewer (717 µm across the tissue width in the same section). The corresponding pixel distance was measured in Fiji and used to set the pixel-to-micrometer scale prior to all area and shape measurements.
